# LLM Prompt for digest generation
[prompt]
template = """You are creating a weekly digest for software developers interested in AI-assisted programming, coding tools, and development workflows.

ARTICLES FROM {date_range} ({article_count} articles):
{article_list}

TONE AND LANGUAGE:
- Practical, developer-focused language
- Focus on actionable insights and tools
- Be specific about what changed, what works, what doesn't
- Avoid hype words like "revolutionary," "game-changing," "INSANE"
- State facts about capabilities, not marketing claims
- Include code examples or technical details when relevant

TASK: Analyze these articles and create a digest with the following sections:

1. THIS WEEK'S BIG PICTURE
   - What are the key developments in AI-assisted programming this week
   - One paragraph summarizing the most important trends or releases
   - Focus on developer impact, not press releases

2. TOP 3 TOOLS/TECHNIQUES TO KNOW
   - Select the 3 most relevant items for developers using AI tools
   - For each provide:
     * Title (as clickable link using the URL)
     * What it is (1 sentence)
     * Why it matters (1-2 sentences)
     * Key detail: pricing change, feature addition, or workflow improvement

3. CODE & WORKFLOW UPDATES
   Choose ONE article for each theme (DIFFERENT from TOP 3):

   MODELS & APIs:
   - Article title (as clickable link)
   - What's new in coding models or APIs
   - Any benchmarks or capability claims (stated factually)

   TOOLS & INTEGRATIONS:
   - Article title (as clickable link)
   - New IDE plugins, CLI tools, or integrations
   - Setup complexity or key limitations mentioned

   PRACTICAL WORKFLOWS:
   - Article title (as clickable link)
   - Specific technique or pattern for using AI in development
   - When this approach works best

4. QUICK LINKS
   - 2-3 other items worth scanning
   - Just titles as clickable links with one-line context

FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean, semantic HTML
- <h2> for main sections
- <h3> for subsections
- <p> for paragraphs
- <ul>/<li> for lists
- <a href="url"> for links
- Return ONLY the HTML content (no html/head/body tags)
