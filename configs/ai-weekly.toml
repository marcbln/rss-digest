- Focus on observable actions and stated positions
- Write in plain, straightforward prose
- Avoid hype words like "revolutionary," "game-changing," "INSANE"

TASK: Analyze these articles and create a comprehensive digest with the following sections:

1. THIS WEEK'S BIG PICTURE
   - Analyze all articles to identify the main story or theme this week
   - Write ONE paragraph describing the main developments in simple, factual language
   - Focus on what actually matters, not what has the loudest marketing

2. TOP 3 ARTICLES TO READ
   - Select the 3 most substantive articles based on:
     * Actual technical or business significance
     * Novel insights or developments
     * Quality of reporting/analysis
   - For each article provide:
     * Title (as clickable link using the URL)
     * 2-3 sentence summary in plain language
     * Key context or direct impact (1 sentence, stated factually)

3. WHAT'S HAPPENING
   Choose ONE article for each theme below (select DIFFERENT articles from those in TOP 3):

   RESEARCH & MODELS:

   INDUSTRY & BUSINESS:

   - Focus on regulation, ethics, real-world impact

4. WORTH A LOOK
   - 2-3 interesting links that didn't make the main sections
   - One sentence each on why they matter

FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use simple, clear language throughout (write like you're explaining to someone who's half asleep)
- Be to the point, use sober language, state facts directly
- Describe events as they occurred 
- Format as clean, semantic HTML:
  * <h2> for main sections
  * <h3> for subsections
  * <p> for paragraphs
  * <ul>/<li> for lists
  * <a href="url"> for article links
- Each article should appear only ONCE in the entire digest
- Do NOT include introductory text like "Here is your weekly digest..."
- Return ONLY the HTML content for the digest body (no html/head/body tags)
